<h2 id="about">About</h2>

I am in my third semester of the M.S. in Computer Science program at the University of Southern California. I am a researcher focused on computer vision (CV), large language models (LLMs), and multimodal generation. At USCâ€™s [Graphics & Vision Lab](https://usc-gvl.github.io/) (advisor: [Prof. Yue Wang](https://yuewang.xyz/)), my work centers on 3D reconstruction under sparse observations, controllable generative rendering, and embodied navigation. More broadly, I explore the intersection of generative models, world modeling, and embodied intelligence: how to build interactive, explorable, high-fidelity worlds from very small sets of real images; how to couple geometric priors with diffusion/autoregressive models to produce videos with temporal consistency and realism; and how to make these capabilities run reliably on edge and in-vehicle platforms.

I am also keenly interested in LLM reasoning and multimodal out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. If you are interested in collaborating, please feel free to reach out. My preferred email is [peilinca@usc.edu](peilinca@usc.edu)
